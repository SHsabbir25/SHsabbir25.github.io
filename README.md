## Hello, I'm Sabbir Shah

I'm an undergraduate student in **Urban and Regional Planning** at Pabna University of Science and Technology, where I'm transforming my passion for sustainable cities into expertise in geospatial technology and data-driven urban solutions.Cities fascinate me not just as places, but as **complex, evolving systems** that shape how millions of people live, work, and thrive. My mission is to understand these systems deeply and use cutting-edge technology to make them more sustainable, resilient, and equitable.I specialize in bridging the gap between **urban planning** and **geospatial intelligence and geostatistics**. Through tools like **ArcGIS Pro,QGIS, Python,R Programming Google Earth Engine, and Machine Learning and Deep learning**, I transform complex spatial data into actionable insights that inform smarter urban decision-making. Whether it's analyzing traffic patterns with **PTV VISSIM** or leveraging **GeoAI** for predictive modeling, I'm driven by the challenge of solving real-world urban problems with innovative technological solutions.My research centers on **advancing open-source geospatial analytics through cloud computing and GeoAI** because I believe powerful planning tools should be accessible to everyone, everywhere.
I'm constantly exploring new frontiers in:
- Geostatistics & spatial analysis
- Deep learning & explainable AI (XAI)
- Spatial databases (PostGIS, DuckDB)
- Cloud-based geospatial computing
  
I'm not just learning about cities,I'm preparing to shape their future. Every project I undertake, every tool I master, brings me one step closer to becoming an expert who can contribute innovative solutions to the urban challenges of tomorrow.
